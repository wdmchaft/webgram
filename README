Webgram is a JavaScript diagramming library for HTML5. It uses the HTML Canvas
element to draw the figures on a web page. The purpose of this project is to
enable the development of all kinds of diagram-based interactive tools on the
web.

The library works well with most modern browsers, but due to the use of the
HTML Canvas technology, version 9 or greater is needed for Internet Explorer. 

This directory contains the source code of the Webgram library. The file
webgram.min.js represents the compiled library (i.e. minified and compressed
into a single .js file). To rebuild it, you need a Linux machine with Java SE 5
or later. Download the Yahoo UI Compressor from
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ and extract it. Alternatively you
could use Douglas Crockford's jsmin tool at
http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html.
Then run the following command (on a Linux system) to obtain the webgram.min.js:
    ./build.sh yui /path/to/yuicompressor-x.y.z.jar
    or
    ./build.sh jsmin /path/to/jsmin

Including the library is simple and straight forward: copy the webgram.min.js
file together with the webgram/images folder to your project's static folder
and load the script into your HTML file(s).

For further information on how to use this library, see the doc/examples folder
and the API documentation in the doc/api-docs folder.
